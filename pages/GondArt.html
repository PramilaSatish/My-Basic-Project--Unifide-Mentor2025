    <h2>Stories in Gond Art</h2>
<p>
“Trees are very important in Gond art. For humans and animals alike – for animals and for birds too, trees are the most 
important – in summer, to protect them from the sun and during the monsoon season to protect from the rain. Trees provide 
nourishment and food too” says artist <u>Venkat Raman Singh Shyam.</u><br>
<b><u>Ganja Mahua Tree:</u></b> It tells the story of a Brahman (upper caste) girl and Chamar (lower caste) boy - when they fell in love, 
society did not accept them. So they renounced everything and went into the forest and later were reborn as Ganja and Mahua 
trees. Hence, it is said that Ganja and Mahua should not be drunk together as they can never be together.<br>
<b><u>Saja Tree:</u></b> The Saja Tree is worshipped by the Bada Dev (Big God) and by the Gond community.<br>
<b><u>Pakri Tree:</u></b> When new leaves bloom from this tree, the Gond community eats a dish (saag) made out of these leaves and this 
protects them from many diseases and illnesses.<br>
<b><u>Peepal Tree:</u></b> The Peepal tree is where the Gods (Devtas) reside and thus the Peepal tree is considered the most important.<br>
<b><u>Tamarind Tree:</u></b> The Tamarind tree also plays an important role for tribal people because they use tamarind fruit for chutney and sell 
the fruit for their livelihoods. Many people in the Gond community place a platform for gods or goddess under the trees.
