<u> Kalamkari</u> is an ancient textile printing art that finds its roots in the Indian state of Andhra
  Pradesh. The ancient textile printing art form is believed to have evolved about 3000 years 
  ago in Andhra Pradesh. Kalamkari gained popularity in the south of India during the reign of
   Vijayanagara Empire. Kalam implies 'pen' and Kari means 'art', a name given by the Mughals
    when they discovered the art during their reign over the Deccan region. Only natural dyes 
    are used in Kalamkari, which involves twenty-three steps.There are two main styles
     of Kalamkari. The block printed that is practised in the town of Machilipatnam and the hand
      painted style that is largely practised in the town of Srikalahasti, both located in 
      Andhra Pradesh.<br>Srikalahasti style of Kalamkari, where the "kalam" or pen is used for
       freehand drawing of the subject and filling in the colours, is entirely hand worked.
        It is produced in Srikalahasti of Tirupati district of Andhra Pradesh. This style 
        flourished in temples centred on creating unique religious identities, appearing on
         scrolls, temple hangings, chariot banners as well as depictions of deities and scenes
          taken from the Hindu epics (e.g. Ramayana, Mahabharata and Purana). The style owes its
           present status to Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay who popularised the art as the first 
           chairperson of the All India Handicrafts Board.

        <h2>History</h2><p>Kalamkari is an ancient textile printing art form that evolved about
     3000 years ago in the state of Andhra Pradesh.The discovery of a resist dyed piece of 
     cloth on a silver vase at the ancient site of Harappa confirms that the tradition of
      Kalamkari is very ancient. Kalamkari style of architecture originated in machilipatnam.
       Musicians and painters, known as chitrakars, moved from village to tell the village
        dwellers the stories of Hindu mythology. They illustrated their accounts using large 
        bolts of canvas painted on the spot with simple means and dyes extracted from plants.
         Similarly, the ones found in Hindu temples are large panels of Kalamkari depicting the
          episodes of Hindu mythology and iconography, similar to Buddhist Thangka paintings.<br>
          The Mughals who patronised this craft in the Coromandel and Golconda province called
           the practitioners of this craft "Qualamkars", from which the term "Kalamkari" 
           evolved.The Pedana Kalamkari craft made in Pedana nearby Machilipatnam in
            Krishna district, Andhra Pradesh, evolved under the patronage of the Mughals and the
             Golconda sultanate. Owing to the said patronage, this school was influenced by 
             Persian art under Islamic rule.</p>

            <h2>Styles</h2>
            <p>
         <u>The Kalahasti style</u> is produced in Srikalahasti of Tirupati district. A "kalam" or pen
          is used for freehand drawing of the subject and filling in the colours and is entirely
           hand worked. This style flourished in temples centred on creating unique religious 
           identities, appearing on scrolls, temple hangings, chariot banners as well as
            depictions of deities and scenes taken from the Hindu epics. As a result it has a 
            distinct religious identity and thrives on mythological themes. The attractive
             blend of colours on the fabrics usually portrays characters from the Indian 
             mythology, with the divinity figures of Brahma, Saraswati, Ganesh, Durga, Shiva 
             and Parvati as the main source of inspiration. The Kalahasti artists generally 
             depict on the cloth the deities, scenes from the epic Ramayana, the Mahabharata, 
             Puranas and other mythological classics mainly producing scrolls, temple backcloths,
              wall hangings, chariot banners and the like.<br>
       <u> In ancient times,</u> the common man learned of gods and goddesses, and of their mythical character 
        from these paintings. Groups of singers, musicians and painters, called chitrakattis, moved from
         village to village narrating the great stories of the Hindu mythology. Progressively, during the 
         course of history, they illustrated their accounts using large bolts of canvas painted on the spot
          with rudimentary means and dyes extracted from plants. Thus, it is believed, was born the first 
          Kalamkari.It was registered as one of the geographical indication from Andhra Pradesh, under 
          handicraft goods by Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999.

            <h2>Middle forms</h2>
            <p>In the Middle Ages, the term was also used to refer to the making of any cotton fabric patterned through 
                the medium of vegetable dyes by free-hand and block-printing, produced in many regions of India. 
                In places where the fabric is block printed, the kalam (pen) is used to draw finer details and for
                 application of some colours.</p><br>
                 <h2>Technique</h2>
                 <p>The first step in creating Kalamkari is steeping it in astringents and buffalo milk and then drying 
                    it under the sun.Afterwards, the red, black, brown, and violet portions of the designs are 
                    outlined with a mordant and cloth are then placed in a bath of alizarin.The next step is to cover 
                    the cloth, except for the parts to be dyed blue, in wax, and immerse the cloth in indigo dye. 
                    The wax is then scraped off and the remaining areas are painted by hand,similar to Indonesian 
                    batik.<br>To create design contours, artists use a bamboo or date palm stick pointed at one end with 
                    a bundle of fine hair attached to this pointed end to serve as the brush or pen.This pen is 
                    soaked in a mixture of jaggery and water; one by one these are applied, then the vegetable dyes are
                     added. <br>In Iran, the fabric is printed using patterned wooden stamps.</p>
                     <img src="C:\Users\Dell\Desktop\UNIFIED MENTOR\BLOG\kalamkari pic\kalamkari007.jpg"
                     height="500px" width="100%">
                     <h2>Colour fixing</h2><p>
                    Dyes for the cloth are obtained by extracting colours from various roots, leaves, and mineral salts of
                     iron, tin, copper, and alum.Various effects are obtained by using cow dung, seeds, plants and 
                     crushed flowers to obtain natural dye. Along with buffalo milk, myrobalan is used in kalamkari.
                      Myrobalan is also used to remove the odd smell of buffalo milk. The fixing agents available in the 
                      myrobalan can easily fix the dye or colour of the textile while treating the fabric. Alum is used in
                       making natural dyes and also while treating the fabric. Alum ensures the stability of the colour in
                        Kalamkari fabric.</p>
                        <h2>Themes</h2><p>Kalamkari specifically depicts epics such as the <u>Ramayana or Mahabharata.</u>
                     However, there are recent applications of the Kalamkari technique to depict Buddha and 
                             Buddhist art forms.In recent times, many aesthetically good figures such as musical 
                             instruments, small animals, flowers, Buddha and few Hindu symbols, like swastika are also
                              introduced to Kalamkari.</p>
                              <h2>Modern day</h2><p><u>Contemporary kalamkari techniques</u> show various departures from the 
                                past. In Masulipatnam, mordant is now uniformly printed with a block. Indigo dyeing has 
                                been given up and the application of the wax resist by kalam has also disappeared.
                                 The mordant for outlining in black remains unchanged, but iron acetate has replaced 
                                 indigo for dyeing the larger areas black, despite its known corrosive qualities. Yellow
                                  dyes are made from dried flowers called aldekai (Telugu) or kadukai (Tamil) of the 
                                  myrobalam, Terminalia chebula.<br>Nowadays, in India, silk, mulmul, cotton, and synthetic
                                   saris are also sold with Kalamkari print. Printing is a much easier task than traditional
                                 Kalamkari work. Kalamkari dupattas and blouse pieces are popular among Indian women.</p>
