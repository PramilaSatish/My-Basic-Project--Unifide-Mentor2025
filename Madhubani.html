    <p><u>Madhubani </u>painting is a folk art of the Mithila region of Bihar, India. This style of 
        painting is characterized by its use of bright colors, geometric patterns, and stylized
         figures. Madhubani paintings are often used to decorate walls, floors, and furniture.
          They are also used to illustrate religious texts and stories. </p>
          <p>Named after the Madhubani district of Bihar, this print is known as<u> ‘Mithila’ 
        </u> and is done by hand on materials ranging from cotton to silk. It features
           bright coloured drawings of lines that characteristically contrast and form a unique 
            pattern. Bright colours are traditionally formulated with natural pigments and dyes 
            like ochre and red. The print can be made with various tools, including twigs, 
            matchsticks, brushes, and pen nibs.</p>

                <div class="b"><h1>Tracing Its Origin</h1>
                    <p> The origin of the Madhubani print can be traced back to the Ramayana,
                         over 2500 years ago. The King of Mithila, Janaka, asked an artist to 
                         paint his daughter Sita’s wedding to Prince Rama. Women typically did 
                         paintings on walls and floors of homes for such special occasions with
                          a paste made from powdered rice. William G. Archer, the British 
                          Colonial Officer in charge of the Madhubani district, officially 
                          discovered this print in 1934 when a massive earthquake hit Bihar. 
                          He came across the wall paintings while inspecting the damage caused 
                          by the natural disaster. <br>
                              Traditionally done on walls (bhittichitra) and floors (aripana), 
                        Madhubani art is now also done on clothes, papers, and canvases 
                        (patachitra). The art skills were passed down from generation to 
                        generation by women who painted people with natural and mythological 
                        elements from ancient epics like the Ramayana and Mahabharata. </p>

                    <div class="d"><h1>Features of Madhubani Painting</h1>
                        <p>
                            Madhubani paintings can be either large, like frescoes, or small,

                            drawings filled in with bright contrasting colors and patterns.
                            The paintings are divided into horizontal and vertical sections 
                            to show different times and places.These are renowned for their 
                            simplicity since the colors and brushes used are frequently made 
                            from natural materials. There are also paintings representing royal 
                            court settings and social gatherings such as weddings.The use of 
                            geometrical patterns is quite obvious in these paintings.
                             The fact that these sophisticated mathematical patterns were 
                             utilized in Madhubani paintings adds to their allure and uniqueness.

                            foreshortened. This is common in Radha-Krishna and Ganesha Madhubani
                             paintings.

                <li>Colors in Madhubani paintings are sourced from plants and other natural 
                    sources and are combined and processed to produce the desired colors.

                    <h1>Materials Used in Madhubani Paintings</h1>
                 <p>Paper: Mithila paintings used to adorn walls with mud and cow dung as
                     base, but from the late 1960s, handmade paper became a canvas of choice. 
                     Handmade paper is crafted using cow dung, neem juice, and multani mitti, 
                     giving it a mud wall-like appearance and protection from termites and 
                     insects. Today, readily available light yellow handmade paper is directly 
                     used for Madhubani paintings.</p>
                <p>Colors: Madhubani paintings feature natural, vibrant colors like red, yellow,
                     blue, and more. Some natural sources for these colors include:</p>
                     <ul type="circle"></ul>
                     <li>Black: Soot mixed with cow dung for borders and outlines.</li>
                     <li>Yellow: Turmeric for yellow hues.</li>
                     <li>White: Rice powder for white.</li>
                     <li>Green: Wood apple tree leaves for green.</li>
                     <li>Blue: Indigo for blue shades.</li>
                     <li>Red: Kusum flowers or red sandalwood for red.</li>
                     <li>Orange: Tesu flowers from the Palash tree for orange.</li>
                     <p>While natural colors are traditional, fabric colors are also used for 
                        durability, although some artists still adhere to traditional methods.</p>
                        <p>Tools: Outlines are created with nib pens and brushes, with natural 
                            or fabric colors filled in using brushes, twigs, matchsticks, and
