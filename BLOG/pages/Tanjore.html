    <p><u>Thanjavur painting</u> is a classical South Indian painting style, originating from the town of Thanjavur (anglicized as 
Tanjore) in <u>Tamil Nadu.</u> The art form draws its immediate resources and inspiration from way back about 1600 AD, a period when 
the Nayakas of Thanjavur under the suzerainty of the Vijayanagara Rayas encouraged art—chiefly, classical dance and music—as
well as literature, both in Telugu and Tamil and painting of chiefly Hindu religious subjects in temples. However, it can
safely be surmised that Thanjavur painting, as we know it now, originated in the <u>Maratha court of Thanjavur (1676-1855)</u>.
It has been recognized as a Geographical indication by the Government of India in 2007-08.</p>
<p>Thanjavur paintings are characterised by rich and vivid colours, simple iconic composition, glittering gold foils overlaid
on delicate but extensive gesso work and inlay of glass beads and pieces or very rarely precious and semi-precious gems. In 
Thanjavur paintings one can see the influence of Deccani, Vijayanagara, Maratha and even European or Company styles of painting.
Essentially serving as devotional icons, the subjects of most paintings are <u>Hindu gods, goddesses, and saints.</u> Episodes from 
<u>Hindu Puranas, Sthala-puranas</u> and other religious texts were visualised, sketched or traced and painted with the main figure or 
figures placed in the central section of the picture (mostly within an architecturally delineated space such as a mantapa or 
prabhavali) surrounded by several subsidiary figures, themes and subjects. There are also many instances when Jain, Sikh, 
Muslim, other religious and even secular subjects were depicted in Tanjore paintings.</p>
<p>Thanjavur paintings are panel paintings done on wooden planks, and hence referred to as palagai padam (palagai = "wooden 
plank"; padam = "picture") in local parlance. In modern times, these paintings have become souvenirs for festive occasions in 
South India.

    <div class="a"><h2>History</h2>
    <p>Thanjavur has a unique place in the history of Indian painting, in that it houses the 11th century Chola wall paintings
in the Brihadeeswarar temple (Periya koyil or Pervudaiyar koyil in Tamil) as also paintings from the Nayak period (many times 
superimposed on the earlier Chola paintings) dating to the 16th century.The fall of the Vijayanagara Empire and the sack
of Hampi in the Battle of Talikota in 1565 CE resulted in the migration of painters who had been dependent on the patronage of 
the empire. Some of them migrated to Thanjavur and worked under the patronage of the Thanjavur Nayakas. Subsequently, the 
Maratha rulers who defeated the Thanjavur Nayakas began to nurture the Thanjavur atelier. The artists absorbed the local 
influences and the individual tastes of their Maratha patrons which helped evolve the unique Thanjavur style of painting. The 
Thanjavur artists in addition to decorating temples also began painting and decorating the major buildings, palaces, chatrams 
and residences of the Maratha kings and nobility.</p>

        <h2>Vijayanagara Rayas</h2>
        <p>The <u>Vijayanagara empire,</u> founded by Harihara and Bukka, was for long a bulwark against the rapidly advancing Islamic 
influence from the nearby Deccan and the farther North. While the foreign influences did gradually percolate into the Peninsular
South, the Vijayanagara empire ensured that the older Hindu artistic traditions were protected and preserved. The empire had 
reached its zenith under <u>Krishnadevaraya (1509-29).</u> Its territory stretched across the entire South Indian peninsula, from the 
<u>Tungabhadra river</u> in the North to <u>Kanyakumari</u> in the south and the Malabar coast on the Arabian sea in the west to the 
Coromandel coast on the Bay of Bengal in the east at its peak. In 1521-22, Krishnadevaraya travelled to the Tamil country 
(Tamilagam) visiting holy places and as was his wont, made munificent donations to temples and other religious establishments.
It can be surmised that some of this munificence was also channeled into art and artists.</p>
</div> 
</div>
<div class="A">
  <h2>Thanjavur Nayakas</h2>
  <p>The Vijayanagara Rayas administered their vast kingdom through Nayaka Governors who also administered the outlying 
provinces or states under the supervision of the Raya. The third important Nayaka state in Tamil country, Thanjavur, (Senji and
Madurai being the others) had been established under the reign of Krishnadevaraya's half-brother and successor Achyutaraya 
(1529-42). The Thanjavur Nayaka line commenced with Sevappa Nayaka (1532-72). Sevappa ruled for several years, ably supported 
by his son Achyutappa (1564-1614), who later succeeded him. It was during Achyutappa's reign that the Vijayanagara empire fell, 
leading to the exodus of numerous litterateurs, philosophers, musicians and artists who migrated to several other neighbouring 
kingdoms like Mysore and Thanjavur. Achyutappa was succeeded by his son Raghunatha Nayaka who in turn was succeeded by 
Vijayaraghava Nayaka. Raghunatha, who was possibly the most successful Thanjavur Nayaka ruler, was also a great patron of art 
and artists and helped establish the unique school of Thanjavur artists who later evolved the Thanjavur style of paintings 
under the Marathas.</p><br>
<h2>Marathas</h2><p>Due to internal dissensions in the Nayaka line, <u>Ekoji</u> otherwise called <u>Venkoji (1676-83),</u> half-brother of 
<u>Chatrapati Shivaji</u> marched into Thanjavur on behalf of the Adil Shah of Bijapur under whom he was a General. He subsequently 
captured Thanjavur and established <u>the Maratha rule.</u> Despite intermittent wars, when Thanjavur was overrun first by the Nawab 
of Arcot and later by Haidar Ali, Ekoji and his successors like Tulajaji, <u>Serfoji II</u> (Sarabhoji in Tamil) and others remained 
great patrons of the arts and artists. By the time Serfoji II succeeded to the Maratha throne in Thanjavur, the Britishers had 
taken over the complete administration of the state, retaining the king in only a nominal capacity to exercise power over the 
fort and a smidgen of surrounding lands. Though Serfoji II had to fight off a spirited competition from Amarasimha, his paternal
 uncle, to the Maratha throne of Thanjavur, it was during his reign that Thanjavur painting flourished and reached the form 
 and style in which we recognise it today. Serfoji II had to traverse a difficult path throughout his reign, being constantly 
 challenged by Amarasimha who ran a parallel court in <u>Thiruvidaimarudur</u> even after his accession. However, despite the troubled 
 times, Serfoji's reign was a time of great innovations in Thanjavur art and many other parallel fields.</p>
 <p>The Maratha rule came to a sad end after the death of its last ruler Shivaji II, (resembling only in name his vastly greater
ancestor) who died without a male issue, when the Britishers obliged by annexing the Thanjavur state to its dominions under the 
notorious <u>Doctrine of Lapse.</u> After the Maratha rule waned, the mercantile <u>Chettiar community</u> continued to patronise the 
Thanjavur artists. The Chettiars being staunch Shaivites encouraged Shaivite themes. One of their monasteries in <u>Koviloor</u> has 
large Thanjavur paintings on the lives of the 63 Nayanmars (Saivaite saints) and the 64 miracles <u>(Thiruvilaiyadal Puranam)</u> of 
Lord Shiva minutely labelled in Tamil.Similarly, the Bhimarajagoswami monastery in Thanjavur has a large painting of 108 
Vishnu temples. The Britishers who had come into Thanjavur in the wake of the <u>Anglo-Mysore wars</u> also patronised Thanjavur 
artists and their paintings.</p>

  <h2>Style and technique</h2>
  <p>
Thanjavur paintings were made in various sizes depending upon the function, the subject and the choice of the patron. Large 
paintings of deities and the Maratha rulers, their courtiers and nobility, were painted and installed to serve as architectural 
accents in the Maratha palaces and buildings. To quote Dallapiccola -"The works, executed on canvas pasted on a wooden support,
were framed-a major departure from the pan-Indian tradition, in which paintings are of small size- and designed to be hung on 
the walls of domestic puja rooms or in bhajan halls. The themes, as in painted albums, (made for European patrons) were usually
gods and goddesses, holy places, religious personalities and occasionally portraits. Their dazzling palette consisted generally 
of vivid reds, deep greens, chalk white, turquoise blues and the lavish use of gold (foil) and inset glass beads. Sometimes 
precious stones were also used in the paintings. The large format of the majority of such works and the relatively simple 
composition are the hallmark of the style. This school was greatly inspired by European techniques and was the most popular in 
Tamil Nadu until the early twentieth century."
  </p>
<p>Paintings in addition to being done on canvas, were also done on walls, wooden panel, glass, paper, mica and exotic media 
such as ivory. Small Ivory portraits were typically worn as cameo pendants called rajaharam and were quite popular.</p>
<p>Thanjavur glass paintings following the techniques of Chinese reverse glass paintings were popularised during Serfoji II's 
reign as a cheaper and faster craft. The paintings were done on the reverse surface of a glass sheet with strips of metal 
beaten into transparent gaps to simulate the effect of jewellery and precious stones. Most of the paintings were of Hindu 
deities & saints. Other courtly and secular portraits were also created.</p>
<p>A Thanjavur Painting was generally made on a canvas pasted over a plank of wood (Jackfruit or teak) with Arabic gum. The 
canvas was then evenly coated with a paste of French chalk (gopi) or powdered limestone and a binding medium and dried. The 
artist then drew or traced using a stencil, a detailed outline of the main and subsidiary subjects on the canvas. A paste, made 
of limestone powder and a binding medium called sukkan or makku, was used for creating the Gesso work. Gold leaves and gems of 
varied hues were inlaid in selected areas like pillars, arches, thrones, dresses, etc. Finally, colours were applied on the 
sketch.</p>
<p>In the past, artists used natural colours like vegetable and mineral dyes, whereas the present day artists use chemical 
paints. For outlines dark brown or red was usually used. Red was favoured for the background, though blue and green were also 
used. Lord Vishnu, was coloured blue, and Lord Nataraja chalk white, and his consort Goddess Sivakami was green. The sky, of 
course, was blue, but black was also employed on occasions. The portrayal of figures in the paintings was also typical with 
almost all the figures having rounded faces with almond-shaped eyes and smooth, streamlined bodies. The composition is static 
and two-dimensional with the figures placed within arches, curtains and decorative borders. The main subject is much larger 
than the other subjects and occupies the centre of the painting. Seraphs or angels resembling those in European paintings and 
Islamic miniatures were also shown flanking the main figure. The figures were painted with bright flat colours except for the 
face where shading was shown. The shading in Thanjavur art was more to create a feeling of depth than to conform to the European
conventions of lighting and perspective.</p>
<p><u>The Government Museum, Chennai </u>and the Thanjavur Art Gallery,Thanjavur also house fine collections of Thanjavur 
paintings depicting <u>the Maratha kings</u> of Thanjavur and other allied subjects. Many private museums and collectors also 
possess enviable collections of Thanjavur paintings.<br>
The British and Victoria & Albert museums in England also house a large collection of Thanjavur paintings in the company and 
traditional styles. The National Museum of Copenhagen also houses a fine collection of 17th century Thanjavur paintings. King 
Christian IV of Denmark had received permission to build a fort at Tranquebar (Tharangambadi in Tamil) which led to the 
building of the Danesborg fort as also a Danish relationship with Thanjavur which resulted in the museum collection.</p>
