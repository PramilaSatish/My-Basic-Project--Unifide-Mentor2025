<p><u><b>The history of Indian drawing art</b></u> dates back to prehistoric times, with the earliest examples being rock paintings and 
carvings. The art has evolved over time, influenced by spirituality, sensuality, and the merging of cultures. </p>
<h2>Early Indian art</h2>
<ol>
    <li><b>Rock art:-</b>The earliest Indian art was rock carvings and paintings, including petroglyphs found in the Bhimbetka 
rock shelters in Madhya Pradesh </li>
<li><b>Ajanta Caves:-</b>A group of Buddhist caves in Maharashtra that were constructed in the 2nd century and are considered 
to be some of India's best surviving art and architecture </li></ol>
<p>Indian art consists of a variety of art forms, including painting, sculpture, pottery, and textile arts such as woven silk. 
    Geographically, it spans the entire Indian subcontinent, including what is now India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, 
    Nepal, Bhutan, and at times eastern Afghanistan. A strong sense of design is characteristic of Indian art and can be 
    observed in its modern and traditional forms.<br>
    The origin of Indian art can be traced to prehistoric settlements in the 3rd millennium BCE. On its way to modern times, 
    Indian art has had cultural influences, as well as religious influences such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism and Islam. 
    In spite of this complex mixture of religious traditions, generally, the prevailing artistic style at any time and place has 
    been shared by the major religious groups.<br>
    In historic art, sculpture in stone and metal, mainly religious, has survived the Indian climate better than other media and 
    provides most of the best remains. Many of the most important ancient finds that are not in carved stone come from the 
    surrounding, drier regions rather than India itself. Indian funeral and philosophic traditions exclude grave goods, which is 
    the main source of ancient art in other cultures.<br>
    Indian artist styles historically followed Indian religions out of the subcontinent, having an especially large influence in 
    Tibet, South East Asia and China. Indian art has itself received influences at times, especially from Central Asia and Iran, 
    and Europe.<br>
    <h2>Purpose of Drawing:-</h2>
Drawing has many purposes in art, including personal expression, documentation, and communication. It can also be a starting 
point for other creative activities.<br>

Documentation Preserve cultural heritage, Serve scientific illustration, Serve architectural drafting needs, and Document some 
evidence or history.<br>
Communication Communicate ideas, Share emotions, and Improve communication skills.<br>
<h2>Starting point for other creative activities:-</h2>Drawings can be a starting point towards other creative activities 
such as painting, sculpture, design, and craft
